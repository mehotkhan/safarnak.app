## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 🔒 Private Disclosure

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email us directly**: Send details to `mehotkhan@gmail.com`
2. **Include**: 
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### 📧 What to Include

Please provide as much detail as possible:

- **Vulnerability Type**: (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, authentication bypass)
- **Affected Components**: Client, Worker, Database, etc.
- **Severity**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed steps to reproduce
- **Environment**: Platform, version, configuration
- **Impact**: What could an attacker do?
- **Suggested Fix**: How you think it should be fixed

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released

## 🔐 Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Password Hashing**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- **Token Generation**: SHA-256 based secure tokens with timestamps
- **Session Management**: Secure token storage and validation
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation on all inputs

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- **Database Security**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM (prevents SQL injection)
- **Client Storage**: Secure token storage in AsyncStorage
- **Offline Security**: Encrypted local data storage

### API Security
- **GraphQL**: Type-safe queries prevent injection attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in Cloudflare Workers rate limiting
- **CORS**: Properly configured cross-origin policies
- **Input Sanitization**: All inputs are validated and sanitized

## 🛠️ Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Authentication
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Use proper password hashing
const hashedPassword = await hashPassword(password, salt);

// ❌ Bad: Never store plain text passwords
const user = { password: plainTextPassword };
```

#### Input Validation
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Validate all inputs
if (!username || username.length < 3) {
  throw new Error('Invalid username');
}

// ❌ Bad: Trust user input
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '${username}'`;
```

#### Token Handling
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Secure token generation
const token = await generateSecureToken(userId, username, timestamp);

// ❌ Bad: Predictable tokens
const token = `${userId}-${username}`;
```

### For Users

#### Password Security
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable biometric authentication when available
- Don't share your account credentials
- Log out from shared devices

#### App Security
- Keep the app updated to the latest version
- Don't install from untrusted sources
- Be cautious with public Wi-Fi
- Report suspicious behavior

## 🔍 Security Audit

### Regular Security Checks
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular security updates
- **Code Reviews**: All changes reviewed for security issues
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated security scanning

### Security Headers
```typescript
// Cloudflare Workers security headers
const securityHeaders = {
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
  'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains',
  'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'self'",
};
```

## 🚫 Known Security Considerations

### Client-Side Security
- **API Keys**: Never expose sensitive API keys in client code
- **Local Storage**: Sensitive data encrypted in AsyncStorage
- **Code Obfuscation**: Production builds are obfuscated
- **Root Detection**: App detects and warns about rooted devices

### Server-Side Security
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive config in environment variables
- **Database Access**: Restricted database access with proper permissions
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages (no sensitive data leaked)
- **Logging**: No sensitive data in logs

## 🔄 Security Updates

### How We Handle Security Updates
1. **Assessment**: Evaluate vulnerability severity
2. **Fix Development**: Create secure fix
3. **Testing**: Thorough security testing
4. **Release**: Deploy fix to production
5. **Communication**: Notify users of security updates

### Update Process
- **Critical**: Immediate fix and release
- **High**: Fix within 1 week
- **Medium**: Fix within 1 month
- **Low**: Fix in next regular release
